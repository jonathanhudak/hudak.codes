I have recently rekindled a love with bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
They may look a bit ugly but you can hack together something useful quite easily.

One thing I have found to be a pain recently is setting up linting, prettier, and commitizen in npm (NodeJS) packages. So as an exercise I took a stab at automating the whole process as outlined in this unaffiliated blog post https://jamesandrewwright.com/articles/commitizen-eslint-prettier-husky

## Run gist from [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

I also created an function for my local Zsh config file that allows me to easily run bash script from a github gist.

⛔️ Note this should be used with caution ⛔️

<Gist gistLink="jonathanhudak/5b9ff8a3e988204be74b80a6004a5e85" />

## Setup a Node package with all the bells and whistles of modern frontend development

Check it out below. If you trust it you can add the function above and then start it up like so:

```bash
gist https://gist.github.com/jonathanhudak/5b9ff8a3e988204be74b80a6004a5e85/raw/ff215be032897140c66accafebcec57c179d1b91/run-remote-gist.sh
```

<Gist gistLink="jonathanhudak/96600bce4540cb7bf29a4b9211bebbc5" />
