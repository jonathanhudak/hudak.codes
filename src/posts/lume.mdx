[Lume](https://lume.land) is an awesome static site generator for the Deno ecosystem. I used it to build this site.

One very trivial thing I struggled with just now is how to include a CSS file in my template. I was trying to do this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

But that didn't work. I got a 404 error. I tried a few other things, but nothing worked. Then I realized that I needed to use the `url` filter:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ '/style.css' }}" />
```
