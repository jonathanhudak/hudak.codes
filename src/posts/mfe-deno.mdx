At work I have been learning and thinking about Micro Frontend Architecture.

I have been using Deno for a while now and I have been thinking about how to use it to build Micro Frontends.

<IframeEmbed src="https://dak-mfe-shell.deno.dev/" />

It is built from multiple independent and isolated servers hosted on Deno Deploy.

- https://dash.deno.com/playground/dak-mfe-shell
- https://dash.deno.com/playground/dak-mfe-nav
- https://dash.deno.com/playground/dak-mfe-home
- https://dash.deno.com/playground/dak-mfe-about

The shell is the main application that loads the other micro frontends.

The manifest is a simple JSON file that contains the list of micro frontends and their URLs.

The nav is a simple navigation bar that is loaded into the shell.

The home and about are simple pages that are loaded into the shell.
