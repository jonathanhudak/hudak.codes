My wife needed a QR code for her popup stand so her customers can easily follow her on her [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cakeforbreakfast.co/).

After searching the web, all the available tools seemed to have an extra scheme. So I decided to timebox how easy it would be to build my own QR code generator. It only took about an hour.

I reached for [Deno](https://deno.land/) since i have been learning about it lately.

Checkout the very simple app here: https://safe-fox-74.deno.dev/

I've made the Deno playground public https://dash.deno.com/projects/safe-fox-74
