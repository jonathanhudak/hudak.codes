I gave an AI agent full access to my digital life. Here's what happened.

## The Setup

On January 31st, I named an AI assistant "Mr. Banana Head" — because if you're going to give software access to your GitHub, email, calendar, and notes, you might as well not take yourself too seriously.

The stack:
- **OpenClaw** — AI agent orchestration running locally on my Mac
- **Discord** — my interface (phone notifications, async conversations)
- **Access** — GitHub, iCloud, Obsidian vault, Apple Reminders, email

The goal: stop being a digital hoarder.

**The wild part:** Almost everything in this post was done via Discord on my phone while I was on vacation in Arizona with my family. I'd send a message, the AI would do the work, I'd approve or redirect. Async collaboration with software.

## The Purge: 99 → 10 Repos

I had 99 public GitHub repositories. Most were abandoned experiments, half-finished tutorials, framework explorations that taught me something and then... sat there. Guilt in repo form.

In one session, the AI:
1. Audited all 147 repos (public + private)
2. Categorized them: active, meaningful, has-stars, archive-candidate
3. Archived 89 repos with a single batch command

What remains: **10 repositories that actually matter.**

```
tools              — main monorepo
hudak.codes        — this blog
jonathanhudak.com  — personal site
theodore-learns-code — for my son
tunr               — web instrument tuner
make-music         — music tools
doris-and-waffle-games — games I made with my kid
visualize-audio    — audio visualization
audio.hudak.land   — audio project
```

**The lesson:** If you wouldn't start it today, archive it. It's not deleted — it's just not cluttering your profile anymore.

## Gmail: 17GB → Less Than 1GB

Years of "I might need this email" had ballooned my Gmail to 17GB. The AI batch-deleted thousands of unstarred emails, keeping only what I'd explicitly marked as important.

One command. 16GB of digital weight — gone.

## Inbox Zero, Finally

My Obsidian vault had 464 files rotting in an inbox folder. Notes I'd captured but never processed. The AI went through every single one:

- Created 17 "Bases" (database views for queries)
- Built 7 Maps of Content (MOCs)
- Archived or properly filed everything

The inbox is now actually empty. Not "I'll get to it empty." Actually empty.

## 137 Reminders → A System That Works

Apple Reminders had become a graveyard of good intentions. 137 incomplete items, some dating back months.

The AI:
- Categorized each reminder (actionable / someday-maybe / archive)
- Scheduled vacation content for my Arizona trip
- Created a triage document with priorities
- Set up recurring check-ins

The difference: a structured system instead of a guilt list.

## Security First

If you're giving AI access to your digital life, you better lock it down first. The AI installed:

- **prompt-guard** — 349 attack pattern detection for group chats
- **dont-hack-me** — security audit for the config
- **Security audit result:** 6/7 PASS, 1 expected warning

## Bespoke Systems > Generic Apps

The most interesting part wasn't the cleanup — it was the custom systems we built:

### Interview System
I realized my notes don't capture my full depth. Christianity, psychedelics, music practice — entire dimensions unmapped. So we built an interview system:

- 10 categories of questions (spiritual journey, formative experiences, values...)
- 3 questions per day via cron job (9am, 2pm, 8pm)
- Living document I can edit anytime
- Answers get synthesized into my knowledge base

No app does this. It exists because I needed it.

### Daily Summary
Every night at 11:59pm, a cron job captures what we accomplished that day. Automatic journaling of actual work, not aspirational todos.

### Gap Scanner CLI
A custom pre-market stock screening tool for my specific trading strategy (Gap & Go). Polygon API integration, free tier, exactly what I need and nothing I don't.

### Puzzle Games for My Son
Theodore (9) has a Daylight Computer with an e-ink display. He needed games. In one day:

- Sokoban (10 levels)
- Word Search (5 themes, 3 difficulties)
- Nonogram (15 puzzles)
- PWA support for offline play
- Touch-optimized, black & white for e-ink

## The Numbers

**4 days. Here's what got done:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Public repos | 99 | 10 |
| Email storage | 17GB | <1GB |
| Obsidian inbox | 464 files | 0 |
| Incomplete reminders | 137 | Triaged |
| PRs merged | — | 30 |
| Commits | — | 77 |
| Issue comments | — | 36+ |
| Blog posts published | 0 in years | 2 |
| Custom tools built | — | 4 |

All of this orchestrated via Discord messages from my phone.

## What I Actually Learned

**Digital clutter is emotional debt.** Every abandoned repo, unread email, and stale reminder carries cognitive weight. You don't notice it until it's gone.

**"Someday maybe" is usually "never."** Archive it. The good ideas will come back.

**Security and cleanup are prerequisites.** Do them first, not after you've already exposed yourself.

**Bespoke > generic when you can build.** Generic productivity apps optimize for everyone. Custom systems optimize for you.

**The assistant works best when you know what you want.** I didn't ask "make me productive." I said "archive these repos" and "build puzzle games for my kid." Specific requests, specific results.

## What's Next

The cleanup is done. Now the interesting part: using this system to actually build things.

- **Farm Stand Disco** — local farm stand discovery for my island
- **Knitting App** — made-to-measure pattern management
- **Gap Scanner** — expanding the trading tools

The difference: I'm not carrying 99 repos of guilt anymore. Just 10 repos of intention.
