The boundaries between server and client-side rendering on the web have been a hot topic lately. I was reading a [css-tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/components-server-side-vs-client-side/) about server-side versus client-side component and re-discovered Turbo build by the Basecamp & Hey team.

After a brief dive into using Turbo I found it incredibly refreshing to knock out HTML CSS and JavaScript and still end up with a snappy and dynamic web application.
With the right design and architecture, Turbo seems like great tool for building web applications without writing tons of JavaScript using React, Vue, Svelte etc.
This is yet another instance of a return to web foundations

Here is a Deno playground hack session https://dash.deno.com/playground/deno-turbo. I used template literals to construct HTML strings.
