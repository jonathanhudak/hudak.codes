        <h1>Three Claudes Walk Into a GitHub Repo</h1>
        <strong>2026-02-02</strong>
      

      <p>I set up an AI to manage other AIs that write code. Here's how to build your own Claude army.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Too many project ideas, not enough time. I'm good at writing detailed requirements, but slow at implementation. The mental context-switching between "architect mode" and "implementation mode" kills momentum.</p>
<p>What if AI could do the boring parts while I focus on what matters — defining <em>what</em> to build and <em>why</em>?</p>
<h2>The Solution: Claude Code GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>Anthropic recently released <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude Code</a>, a CLI tool that lets Claude write code in your repositories. Combined with GitHub Actions, you get something powerful: <strong>write an issue, get a pull request</strong>.</p>
<p>The workflow looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You</strong> write a detailed issue (feature request, bug report, or PRD)</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Action</strong> triggers when you @mention Claude</li>
<li><strong>Claude Code</strong> reads the issue, writes the code, runs tests</li>
<li><strong>Pull Request</strong> is created automatically</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> (or another AI) review and merge</li>
</ol>
<h2>Setting It Up</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Install the GitHub App</h3>
<p>Run this in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">claude /install-github-app
</code></pre>
<p>This opens a browser to authorize the Claude Code GitHub App. Select the repositories you want to enable.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Add the Workflow File</h3>
<p>Create <code>.github/workflows/claude.yml</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml">name: Claude Code

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  claude:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude') || contains(github.event.issue.body, '@claude')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Run Claude Code
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 3: Add Your API Key</h3>
<p>Go to your repo's Settings → Secrets → Actions, and add:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</code>: Your Claude API key from <a href="https://console.anthropic.com">console.anthropic.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Write an Issue</h3>
<p>Here's an example issue that works well:</p>
<pre class="language-markdown" tabindex="0"><code class="language-markdown">## Feature: Add Dark Mode Toggle

### Context
Users have requested a dark mode option. The app currently only supports light mode.

### Requirements
- Add a toggle button in the header
- Persist preference in localStorage
- Use CSS custom properties for theme colors
- Default to system preference

### Technical Notes
- Use the existing Button component
- Theme colors should be defined in `src/styles/theme.css`

@claude please implement this feature
</code></pre>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<h3>Be Specific in Your Issues</h3>
<p>The quality of Claude's output directly correlates with the quality of your input. Vague issues get vague code. Detailed PRDs get production-ready implementations.</p>
<p>Include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: Why does this feature exist?</li>
<li><strong>Requirements</strong>: What specifically needs to happen?</li>
<li><strong>Technical notes</strong>: Any constraints or existing patterns to follow?</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance criteria</strong>: How do we know it's done?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The OAuth vs API Key Gotcha</h3>
<p>I spent an hour debugging "unauthorized" errors before realizing the difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub App OAuth</strong> (via <code>/install-github-app</code>): Lets Claude access your repos</li>
<li><strong>Anthropic API Key</strong> (in secrets): Lets the Action call Claude's API</li>
</ul>
<p>You need both. The error messages don't make this obvious.</p>
<h3>Claude Reads Your Entire Repo</h3>
<p>Before writing code, Claude analyzes your existing codebase. It picks up on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding style and conventions</li>
<li>Existing patterns and abstractions</li>
<li>Project structure</li>
<li>Dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the generated code usually matches your style. It's not just plopping in generic solutions.</p>
<h3>Review Still Matters</h3>
<p>Claude is good, not perfect. I've seen it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miss edge cases the issue didn't mention</li>
<li>Over-engineer simple features</li>
<li>Use deprecated APIs (its training has a cutoff date)</li>
</ul>
<p>Treat Claude's PRs like PRs from a junior developer who codes fast but needs review.</p>
<h2>The Three Claudes Pattern</h2>
<p>Here's where it gets interesting. I run three Claude instances:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Claude Code Action</strong>: Writes code from issues</li>
<li><strong>Claude in my terminal</strong>: For local development and debugging</li>
<li><strong>Claude as an assistant</strong>: Reviews PRs, manages projects, monitors activity</li>
</ol>
<p>They coordinate through GitHub. The assistant @mentions the Action, reviews its PRs, and handles the project management layer. It's Claudes all the way down.</p>
<h2>Real Results</h2>
<p>After setting this up across three of my repos, here's what happened in one night:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Project</th><th>Feature</th><th>Time to PR</th><th>Lines of Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Music app</td><td>Chord quiz game</td><td>3m 46s</td><td>733</td></tr><tr><td>Utility app</td><td>PDF text extraction</td><td>2m 57s</td><td>432</td></tr><tr><td>Side project</td><td>Backend API</td><td>6m 22s</td><td>1,159</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>That's 2,300+ lines of code from three detailed issues, ready for review in under 15 minutes of wall clock time.</p>
<h2>Should You Do This?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes, if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You're good at writing requirements but context-switching to implementation is costly</li>
<li>You have many small features/bugs that don't justify deep focus time</li>
<li>You want to prototype ideas quickly before investing manually</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not yet, if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your codebase has no conventions (Claude will make inconsistent choices)</li>
<li>You need highly-specific domain knowledge (Claude knows general patterns, not your business logic)</li>
<li>Security is paramount (review AI-generated code carefully before merging)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>This isn't about replacing developers. It's about changing what developers do.</p>
<p>Instead of: <em>"I'll spend 2 hours implementing this feature"</em></p>
<p>It becomes: <em>"I'll spend 20 minutes writing a detailed spec, let Claude implement it, then spend 15 minutes reviewing and adjusting."</em></p>
<p>The skill shifts from "writing code" to "writing specifications" and "reviewing code." Those are different muscles.</p>
<p>For me, this means more time thinking about what to build and less time on the mechanics of building it. Your mileage may vary.</p>
