I have been learning about [Deno](https://deno.land/) lately and often in prototypes I want to serve a simple HTML page so I created this simple module which simplifies creating a basic HTMl page.

In the process I learned about how to [setup a Deno Third Party Module](https://deno.land/add_module) and how to get it deployed to https://deno.land/x

```ts
import { Application, Router } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts";
import { makeHTMLPage } from "https://deno.land/x/html_page/mod.ts";

const router = new Router();

router.get("/", async (context) => {
  context.response.body = makeHTMLPage({
    body: `<h1>Hello Deno ðŸ¦•</h1>`,
    title: "html_page",
  });
});

const app = new Application();
app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());

await app.listen({ port: 8002 });
```
